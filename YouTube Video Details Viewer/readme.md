This program displays the details of a YouTube video given the URL.

# What can be displayed
The following information can be displayed using this program:
* Video title
* Uploaded User
* Number of views
* Number of likes
* Number of comments
* Upload date

However, specifying a short video is considered invalid and must be replaced with:

## Note
For unknown reasons, line breaks in the description are not displayed correctly(If you copy the content, the line breaks will be reflected correctly).
Also, due to font restrictions, emojis will not display properly.
