# C# Apps Repository
I'm distributing an application created in C# here.
<br>Here you will find various garbage applications as well as useful applications.

# Purpose
Because uploading to separate repositories results in more garbage repositories.

# Kinds
This includes programs created with Windows Forms applications and console applications.
<br>VB.NET is not included as it is not C#.

# Reporting an issues
To report a bug, certain conditions must be met.
<br>You can find those conditions [here](https://github.com/YuuyaGitHub/CS-Apps-Repository/blob/main/bugreport.md).
